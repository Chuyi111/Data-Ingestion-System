I can still chat with my friends, there are still no (forced) ads. However recently the program has become so incredibly bloated, slow, annoying to use, introducing useless features at every corner and being actively hostile to the user. Please avoid using this if you can use an alternative instead.",

When someone goes invisible, it can feel like avoidance or exclusion, especially without communication.

What I REALLY dislike though, is Nitro. Whenever I send a video that's even just a BIT too long, there's a pop up telling me it takes too much space and I should get Nitro to send it. Even when I want to decorate my profile, or add a banner, I NEED NITRO. This app is so greedy it's insane. But besides all that, its okay.",

    "content": "It feels like every update is slowly making this application worse and worse. When it comes to uploading images, the image tab gets stuck and I have to force stop discord in my settings to reset it, Discord streams now have a rotation issue where if your phone is angled in a certain way, the stream is cut in half, & finally, there has been this very transparent \"screenshot\" of the stream your viewing on the top left of the screen whenever you open Discord, its rare but annoying",
