I'll pay whatever up charge, make sure it applies, and then... always... It arrives at least two or three hours late. sometimes I need something to arrive before I leave for work so it says it'll be there from 5-7am, but it shows up at 1-2pm. please stop claiming early delivery, if it is always late.",

It was THE reason I preferred the Android app over iOS. Now it's as bad as iOS, with orders of all statuses mixed up. I have to scroll through old ones to find things still on their way. The sorting options don't help with this—please add this option to sort by delivery date! TOO EASY TO MISS MISSING ORDERS! Is this what you're going for?",
