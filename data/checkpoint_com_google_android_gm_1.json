    "content": "After promotions tab has 2 option of most recent and most relevant emails, the experience of the app has severely degraded. Whenever I open the promotions tab, it always starts with most relevant. There is no option to set most recent as the default. Also the promotion tab banner now shows promotion emails as unread when I open the app and am present in the default primary tab even if I have read all promotion emails. This is very annoying since it gives false impression of unread emails.",

I do not want label notifications (promos, updates, etc.), I only want primary email notifications and as soon as you uncheck labels for notifications, it turns all your email notifications off. This has never worked this way in the past so I am either inundated or receive nothing. This is basically not functional for everyday use at this point.",

Google can collect dozens and dozens of data points on itsnusers to sell to ANYONE but can't design an email host above a high school level, even after 20+ years. They also regularly lose files/data from Google Drive with zero recourse; there IS no support for your paid service. Hate to say it, but I may move to Apple after this device.",
