This game is so horrible now, either through it being so incredibly p2w and skill not being a factor anymore. Or its the absurd mechanic called \"tilting\" where the game purposely makes you lose through not putting you against the first player but rather a guaranteed loss. Another awesome thing is the devs just dont care about the player base at all. Don't play this game, its horrible.",

For the first time since launch, I am uninstalling the game. I was burnt out on the traditional version, so merge tactics was a nice change. But after this ones release, it breaks the game. no skill necessary to use it. no matter how big your people, getting one shot on top of it taking 3 or more of my cards out with a single hit.

    "content": "P2w+ rigged matchmaking; if you lose 3 times in a row with goblin curse next match you get someone with a super swarmy deck and the match ends with you 3 crowning in 1 minute. The game tries to keep you hooked and sacrifice someone that has a good day. But people still leave bc of the p2w. One time in clan wars with 5k trophies I got paired up against a 2000 trophy guy that had a full 13 lvl deck and the only thing he was doing is putting 3Ms at the bridge, even my lightning couldn't kill them.",

As most play might already how the mechanic works. It's no longer fun when a 4 star sage just automatically wipes out your well built team no matter how good the synergies are.",

I thought the new update would kill the game but I found heros to add maybe more skill or at the very least new pushes to the game. Looking foward to the next season and recommend this to people with money or dedication. Lots of people like to say f2p in clash is impossible and to hit uc is unrealistic but it's very possible me doing that.",

    "content": "Awesome game, except it's now turned into a P2W game. The latest inclusion of the heroes, and removing of books, EWC also ruined the game structure we have known for the last decades. not only that, they should be focusing on their old ideas to improve the current structure but they proceed to introduce a new structure to the game, which destroys the balance tilting the game into P2W user favour. not to mention the nasty bugs still happening.",

I've played this game for 8 years and I am still missing about 20% of the op broken evos and hero's. If you have £2000 to sink into a video game",
