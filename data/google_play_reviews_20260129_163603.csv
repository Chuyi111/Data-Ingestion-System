Many times, the chat backup fails, and because of this, entire chat histories get deleted. This is very frustrating, especially when chats contain important personal or work-related information. Why does WhatsApp still depend so heavily on device-based backups (Google Drive/iCloud)? Why can’t chat history be handled more like Instagram, where messages are safely stored on servers and not lost due to backup failures.",2026-01-28T11:45:41,0,2.26.2.72,,,2026-01-29T16:31:55.693781

Wish there was a setting to go back to the old layout. Reviewing system sucks, I reported many ONLYFANS/very inappropriate accounts when I see them, & only a few of them get removed. Insta is supposed to make us feel safe & comfortable, but how am I supposed to, when they just restrict those accounts a little bit?

bc822265-1ac1-4dcc-b490-1c9242c35f42,com.instagram.android,Calista,4,I absolutely love this app except one thing. How do we have ads that pop up while watching a reel yet we dont have a feature that allows us to remove all liked reels/posts? And why is that even a thing anyways? Fix this and maybe people would like you better than TikTok. p.s. dont copy tiktok bro,2026-01-28T11:41:15,0,,,,2026-01-29T16:32:09.841281

I have been getting restrictions for gift solicitation, and I'm not using any other app or program. All I'm doing is play the game and talk to the viewers. It tells me to encourage viewers to send gifts, but I don't stream for gifts, and I get restricted for gift solicitation anyway. I also can't like any of my friends' posts because tiktok said that I have been liking too fast, clearly not true. No way to fix",2026-01-22T07:55:56,11,34.5.5,,,2026-01-29T16:32:27.541980

I have all my friend request notifications turned off and I still get stranger friend requests every single day and it's very annoying! This is such a strange feature. I don't know who would accept strangers anyway and I don't like that they can see my profile when I only want to connect with my friends and family. i may need to delete the app if I can't turn it off.,2026-01-27T22:51:25,0,13.76.0.46,,,2026-01-29T16:34:04.994188

Every snap you post is a tiny piece of your story, a glimpse of who you are today, not who you were yesterday or who you’ll be tomorrow. Some days you post because you’re happy. Some days because you’re bored. And some days because you don’t want to feel alone. That’s okay. Not every snap needs a reason.

The storage issue is something new and was never a problem before. What’s disappointing is that many features now depend on payment options. Not everyone has a credit card, and free users are not at fault for that. Limiting basic usage because of storage feels unfair.

Google used to follow better rollout strategies. Where's the common courtesy to tell your users you'll do something major? The app keeps pestering me and won't respect my settings. photo search is buggy.,2026-01-27T08:58:16,10,7.59.0.856624550,,,2026-01-29T16:35:12.165494

c8c9559e-7f54-48ee-b7b9-d403954673e9,com.google.android.apps.photos,Evgany Vorona,3,The backup is broken on devices with ColorOS like OnePlus 15. When the image is taken with the camera the Google Photos app starts uploading it to the cloud instantly before the ColorOS camera processed the image. So the result is all photos that are being uploaded to the cloud are very low quality and blurred. A temporary solution is to disable Google Photos background data so photos are not uploaded instantly or disable automatic backup and backup manually.,2026-01-27T07:04:28,3,7.60.0.859276722,Hi Evgany.

For example, going to the borrow tab, will tell me how much was borrowed, and the total amounts left to be paid, but it isn't clearly laid out, and can be a bit misleading. Due to a small oversight, I thought I wasn't due to make a payment until next week, but then I receive an email telling me I missed a payment the day before, the apps tab didn't show it.",2026-01-25T00:58:04,0,5.35.0,"Hi Deshon, thank you for taking the time to make this comment, we totally understand how distressful can be when the app is not so clear, and we appreciate the feedback regarding this, as we always want to improve for you.

The new mechanics seems fun and exciting. Especially the new game mode, Merge tactics. Quite fun strategic game mode, which feels very fresh.

Me being a free to play player made this really hard. I thought the new update would kill the game but I found heros to add maybe more skill or at the very least new pushes to the game. Looking foward to the next season and recommend this to people with money or dedication.
